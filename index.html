<button class="collapsible">  </button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    Template engines simplify the process of generating dynamic HTML pages using static templates.

<div class="sectionheading"> React components, state, props, jsx, rxjs, virtual DOM </div>

<button class="collapsible">  </button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    Components - React is built around the concept of reusable components, which are small, self-contained units of code that can be composed together to build complex user interfaces.
  </p>
  <p>State - A component's state is an object that holds information about the component's current state, which can change over time in response to user actions or other events.</p>
  <p>Props - Props (short for "properties") are passed down from a parent component to a child component, and are used to provide data and configuration to the child component.</p>
  <p>JSX - JSX is a syntax extension that allows developers to write HTML-like code in their JavaScript code, making it easier to write and reason about UI components.</p>
  <p>RxJS - RxJS is a library for reactive programming that is often used in conjunction with React. It provides a way to handle asynchronous events and data streams in a more declarative and composable way.</p>
  <p>Virtual DOM - React uses a virtual DOM, which is an in-memory representation of the actual DOM. The virtual DOM allows React to perform updates to the UI in a more efficient way by minimizing the number of DOM operations needed.</p>

  <div class="sectionheading"> session and sessionStorage, localStorage, IndexedDB </div>

<button class="collapsible">  </button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
   Session and sessionStorage - Session and sessionStorage are both mechanisms for storing data on the client-side that is specific to a particular session or tab in the browser. Session data is stored in the browser's memory and is cleared when the session is ended, while sessionStorage data is stored in the browser's memory but is cleared when the tab is closed. 
 </p>
  <p>LocalStorage - LocalStorage is a mechanism for storing data on the client-side that persists even after the browser is closed. LocalStorage data is stored in the browser's local storage, which is a persistent store that can be accessed across sessions and tabs.</p>
  <p>IndexedDB - IndexedDB is a more advanced mechanism for storing data on the client-side that allows for more structured storage and more powerful queries. It is designed for applications that need to store large amounts of structured data, and provides a more robust set of features than sessionStorage or localStorage.</p>
